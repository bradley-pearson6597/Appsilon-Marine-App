# Appsilon-Marine-App
## Introduction
This app was created as a recruitment task for Appsilon. The dataset provided was on the journey taken by vessels, ships.csv. The aim of this project was to incorporate the shiny.semantic package into a working app which has a set of features stated in the initial recruitment task.
## Feature List
* Dropdown menus for Vessel Type and Vessel Name.
* Map displaying longest distance travelled by selected vessel between 2 consecutive observations (with key).
* Formula for calculating longest distance (Harversine Formula).
* Data of selected vessel (Downloadable as CSV format).
* Information on vessel (Speed, Destination, Time for Distance & Distance Travelled).
* Overall route map of vessel.
## Usage
All libraries required can be seen the global.R file. The base of the app was created using shiny.semantic 0.4.0.
## Roadmap
Future additions to the app could include:
* Plots showing changes in distance over time.
* Comparisons between ships.
